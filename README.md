# CSES_DP_section

~This repo contains my past submissions to the problems of the DP section of CSES Problem Set. <br /> <br />
~Tasks can be seen under the Dynamic Programming section given at https://cses.fi/problemset/ <br /> <br />
~Raw codes are first submitted in CSES judge and then fed into chatgpt for adding comments and wrapping the logic under class. Core logic remains the same. Prompt given to chatgpt is as below.

```
I will give you:
1. A raw C++ solution to a CSES problem (without comments).
2. The problem link.

Your task:
- At the very top of the file, add:
  1. The problem title (as it appears on CSES).
  2. The problem link.
  3. A 2–3 line comment written in the first person describing my thought process and intuition for solving it, based on the code I provided.
- Reformat the code so indentation and spacing follow clean, standard C++ style.
- Refactor the code so that:
  - The main solving logic is inside a member function of a class (e.g., class Solution { public: void solve(); };).
  - main() simply creates an instance of the class and calls that function.
- Go through the code and add concise, beginner-friendly, technically correct inline comments wherever you feel an explanation would help (especially for tricky logic or important steps).
- Keep all variable names and the algorithm’s behavior the same unless a rename is required for clarity.
- Also add time and space complexity analysis and the thought process behind the approach.
- Return only the final annotated C++ file.
